Here, placed side-by-side for comparison, are implementations of cat(1)
from GNU's coreutils, Plan 9, Busybox, toybox, xv6, NetBSD, OpenBSD,
FreeBSD, DragonflyBSD, Ultrix 3.1, Seventh Edition Unix (1979), Tenth
Edition Unix (1989), and 4.3BSD.

For good measure (and because I suppose I am now committed to collecting
cats) also included are Second Edition Unix (in assembly) and Inferno's
implementation (in Limbo).  There is also an example that ships with the
readline source, apparently; I found it in /usr/share/readline/rlcat.c.
Another oddity, p9p comes with libbio/bcat.c.

All cat.c files (renamed by prefixing the name of the source of the
source) are presented, unaltered and in their entirety.  Note how easy
it is to read and understand plan9-cat.c (which should take only a
couple of minutes, possibly even for coders that don't know C). Other
than that, I think the files speak for themselves.

Keep in mind while reading that the cat utility's purpose is to
concatenate files.  (The obvious implied commentary aside, it is almost
like a collection of napkin doodles from artists: self-contained samples
of different styles.)

Lastly, here are the line and character counts, sorted:
